Here is a stack of 3 members S5731-S48P4X (V200R021C10SPC600 + V200R021SPH220). 
This is an access stack for wired users.

Network Access Control (NAC) Unified Mode configured on the stack.

Authentication-profile applied on each access edge port.

Authentication-profile include dot1x and MAC address authentication.

And has following configuration:

According to this configuration, the customer's expectations were as follows:

1.      port-security configuration has a higher priority. 
Only two MAC addresses can be learned by the port. 
In other words, in any scenario, even when receiving any kind of BUM traffic, 
then only two MAC addresses (taken as a source MAC from the first two received packets) 
will be learned and displayed by command «dis mac-address GigabitEthernet2/0/5».

 

2.      Since dot1x and MAC address authentication profiles include command 
«authentication trigger-condition arp dhcp any-l2-packet», then any ARP, 
DHCP or L2 packet (include BUM) received by interface will trigger authentication process. 
https://support.huawei.com/hedex/hdx.do?docid=EDOC1100247314&id=EN-US_CLIREF_0176369431. 
“Trigger authentication process” means the access device (the stack switch) encapsulates 
the received ARP, DHCP or L2 packet into a RADIUS Access-Request packet, and sends the 
resulting packet to the RADIUS server.

 

3.      To prevent unauthorized users from occupying user entries on the device maliciously, 
customer run the «authentication mode multi-authen max-user 3» command in the authentication profile view
 to configure the maximum number of 3 access users allowed on each interface. 
 https://support.huawei.com/hedex/hdx.do?docid=EDOC1100247314&id=EN-US_CLIREF_0176369431. 
 It was expected that only for 3 users from each port would be trigger authentication process. 
 And since port-security allowed only 2 MAC-addresses to be learned on the port, 
 therefore only for 2 users from each port would be trigger authentication process. 
 So, it was expected that MAC address table and «display access-user access-type dot1x» 
 would be look like that:

 

 

<swX>dis mac-address GigabitEthernet2/0/5

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1       user1                  10.XX.XX.201                             00e0-4cXX-XXX1 Pre-authen         
 2       user2                  10.XX.XX.178                             00e0-4cXX-XXX9 Pre-authen         
 
 
 




 

In other words, only 3 users from each interface will be added to the user entries. 
But since port-security limits the number of MAC addresses, we should see only 2 entries here. 
If 2 more MAC addresses are learned from another interface, then +2 more entries will added in the 
user entries table.

«authentication mode multi-authen max-user 3» limits user entries for users in ANY user status 
(Open, Success, Pre-authen, Client-no-resp, Fail-authorized). 
It does not mean that user entries will be limited only for users in Success status. 
For example, if user entries table already contain 3 users: first in status Open, second in status 
Success, and last in status Pre-authen, this means no more free users entry available.

 

4.      Since authentication profile include command «authentication event authen-fail action authorize 
service-scheme authen-fail» and associated ACL permit all IPs, 
it was expected that the stack switch grants all right to all users who have failed in authentication. 
https://support.huawei.com/hedex/hdx.do?docid=EDOC1100247314&id=EN-US_CLIREF_0176369660

It was expected that all users who have failed in authentication will have status 
« Fail-authorized» under command «display access-user».

[Here's what really happened]:

1.      Accidentally another access switch was connected to the port GigabitEthernet2/0/5.

2.      This connected switch had video devices connected to it. 
These video devices generated a lot of multicast and broadcast traffic.

3.      All these video devices were from another network, and did not require authentication.

4.      We suspect the switch was connected at 2024-06-11 07:29:49. 
The incident was found 2024-06-19 11:28:00. Resolved 2024-06-19 14:44:10 
(GigabitEthernet2/0/5 was shutdown).

5.      152 MAC-addresses was learned by interface GigabitEthernet2/0/5 (logs_mac.txt):



<swX>dis mac-address GigabitEthernet2/0/5
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MAC Address    VLAN/VSI/BD                       Learned-From        Type

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Total items displayed = 152

 

 

It is clear that «port-security max-mac-num 2» command did not take effect here on the interface. 
152 MAC-addresses was learned instead of 2.

 

6.      GigabitEthernet2/0/5 started dropped multicast and broadcast traffic (logs_mac.txt):

 

#Jun 19 2024 14:40:05+03:00 sw2.z383 SECE/4/TRAFFICSUPPRESSION_DROP_ALARM:OID 
1.3.6.1.4.1.2011.5.25.32.4.1.14.3 Incoming packet loss occurs due to traffic suppression. 
(IfIndex=118, IfName=GigabitEthernet2/0/5, BroadcastPktDropped=988160, MulticastPktDropped=15402, 
UnicastPktDropped=0, KnownMulticastPktDropped=0, KnownUnicastPktDropped=0)

 

7.      The number of NAC users reaches the upper limit:

 

2024-06-19 14:36:21+03:00 swX %%01CM/3/ALLOCUSERFAIL(l)[57]:Slot=1,Vcpu=3;The number of NAC users 
reaches the upper limit.(UserIP:192.168.XX.XX,Mac:f023-XXXX-XXXX,Interface:GigabitEthernet2/0/5)

 

Jun 19 2024 12:13:44+03:00 swX AAA/4/NACMaxUserAlarm:Slot=1,Vcpu=4;OID 1.3.6.1.4.1.2011.5.2.2.2.0.107 
The number of NAC users reached the maximum.(Slot:All User-num:1000 Threshold:100%)

2024-06-19 12:13:44+03:00 swX %%01CM/3/ALLOCUSERFAIL(l)[1321127]:Slot=1,Vcpu=3;The number of NAC users 
reaches the upper limit.(UserIP:192.168.XX.XX,Mac:f023-XXXX-XXXX,Interface:GigabitEthernet2/0/5)

 

a.Considering that there are usually no more than 50 users on the stack, it looks strange that users 
entry table has reached the upper limit of 1000 users. There were 50 users on the stack when issue 
occurred, and 152 came from another switch from port GigabitEthernet2/0/5. So the total should be 202 
users in NAC users entry table. Not 1000.

It looks like every incoming L2 packet that arrived on the interface GigabitEthernet2/0/5 triggered 
authentication over and over again for each MAC-address in MAC-address table.

The logs show that every 5 minutes the stack tries to authenticate each MAC over and over again:

 

2024-06-18 23:00:50+03:00 swX %%01CM/5/USER_ACCESSRESULT(s)[1228265]:Slot=1,Vcpu=3;
[USER_INFO_AUTHENTICATION]DEVICEMAC:5c-XX-XX-XX-XX-d0;DEVICENAME:swX;USER:;MAC:f0-XX-XX-XX-XX;
IPADDRESS:192.168.X.XX;IPV6ADDRESS:-;TIME:1718740839;ZONE:UTC+0300;DAYLIGHT:false;ERRCODE:
4294967295;RESULT:Pre-authen;CIB ID:1890;INTERFACE:GigabitEthernet2/0/5;ACCESS TYPE:None;RDSIP:-;
Portal TYPE:-;AUTHID=635145626;AUTHPROTOCOL:-;



 

This indicates that the NAC user entry table processed queries incorrectly, 
it did not have time to delete outdated entries or duplicate entries.

 

b.And it is clear that «authentication mode multi-authen max-user 3» 
command did not take effect here. Only 3 new entries had to be added to the NAC users entry table. 
According to the logs, authentication requests were triggered by stack for each of the 152 MAC addresses 
in the mac address table. This means that all 152 entries (not 3) were added in the NAC users entry table.

[Resume]:

From all of the above, it is clear that the switch has a security hole, 
the NAC algorithms are not working correctly and must be fixed. 
Even such a small number of broadcast and multicast packets from 152 devices caused the 
failure of the NAC function, in which existing users began to lose connectivity and could not 
online again. 

Please pay attention of this issue.

 


 PSE:

Maximum number of users on an interface, authentication has a higher priority than port-security.

Current implementation mechanism of device is as following: 
device authenticates all the mac-addresses that send arp/dhcp/any-l2-packet packets, 
therefore 152 MAC addresses are displayed in the "display mac-address" command output.
Theoretically, the "display access-user" command output also should show that 152 users
 are in the pre-authen state. Therefore, we have been expecting to collect the 
 previously mentioned commands for further confirmation.

We admit that the current implementation mechanism has problems, so we confirm with the R&D 
that this mechanism will be modified in R24 version.
After the modification, as per current customer configuration, 
only 2 mac-addresses are displayed in the "display mac-address" command output and only 3 users 
are displayed in the "display access-user" command output.
