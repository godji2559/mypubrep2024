This document contains a description of a bug in the Network Access Control 
(NAC) function Huawei S series switches V200R21 firmware version. 
The bug was identified and described in June 2024 by Huawei TAC network 
engineer Tubaev Vasilii.
The document was accepted by the RND, the bug was addmited and identified 
as DTS2024032709699.
The fix will be implemented in the release V200R024 in October/November 2024.


[Expectations]

Here was a stack of 3 switches S5731-S48P4X (V200R021C10SPC600 + patch 
V200R021SPH220). 
This was an access stack for wired users.
Network Access Control (NAC) Unified Mode was configured on the stack.
Authentication-profile was applied on each access edge port.
Authentication-profile included dot1x and MAC address authentication.
Port-security was enabled on each edge port.

Configuration was as followed:

#
authentication-profile name XXXX
 dot1x-access-profile XXXX
 mac-access-profile XXXX
 authentication mode multi-authen max-user 3
 access-domain ozon_dot1x force
 authentication event authen-fail action authorize service-scheme authen-fail
 authentication event authen-server-noreply action authorize keep
 authentication dot1x-mac-bypass
 link-down offline delay 5
#
dot1x-access-profile name XXXX
 dot1x timer reauthenticate-period 7200
 dot1x timer client-timeout 2

 authentication access-point max-user 2
 port-security enable
 port-security max-mac-num 2
 unicast-suppression packets 100
 multicast-suppression packets 20
 broadcast-suppression packets 40
#

According to the performed configuration, the customer's expectations 
were as follows:

1.  Port-security configuration has a higher priority. 
Only two MAC addresses can be learned by the port. 
In other words, in any scenario, even when receiving any kind of 
BUM traffic, then only two MAC addresses (one source MAC address from each of 
the two received packets) will be learned and displayed by command 
«display mac-address GigabitEthernet2/0/5».

2.  Since dot1x and MAC address authentication profiles included command 
«authentication trigger-condition arp dhcp any-l2-packet», then any ARP, 
DHCP or L2 packet (include BUM) received by the interface will trigger 
authentication process. 
https://support.huawei.com/hedex/hdx.do?docid=EDOC1100247314&id=EN-US_CLIREF_0176369431. 
“Trigger authentication process” means the access device (the stack switch) encapsulates 
the received ARP, DHCP or L2 packet into a RADIUS Access-Request packet, and sends the 
resulting packet to the RADIUS server.

3.  To prevent unauthorized users from occupying user entries on the device maliciously,
customer run the «authentication mode multi-authen max-user 3» command in the 
authentication profile view to configure the maximum number of 3 access users allowed 
on each interface. 
https://support.huawei.com/hedex/hdx.do?docid=EDOC1100247314&id=EN-US_CLIREF_0176369431. 
It was expected that only for 3 users from each port would be trigger authentication 
process. And since port-security allowed only 2 MAC-addresses to be learned on the port, 
therefore only for 2 users from each port would be trigger authentication process. 
It was expected that MAC address table and «display access-user access-type dot1x» 
would be look like that:

<swX>dis mac-address GigabitEthernet2/0/5
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MAC Address    VLAN/VSI/BD                       Learned-From        Type

00e0-4cXX-XXX9 104/-/-                           GE2/0/5             authen

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Total items displayed = 2

===============================================================================
  ===============display access-user access-type dot1x wired===============
===============================================================================
 process  3:
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 UserID  Username               IP address            MAC            Status
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1       user1                  10.XX.XX.201       00e0-4cXX-XXX1 Pre-authen         
 2       user2                  10.XX.XX.178       00e0-4cXX-XXX9 Pre-authen         
 
In other words, only 3 users from each interface must be added into the 
users entries table. But since port-security limits the number of MAC addresses, 
we should see only 2 entries here. 
If 2 more MAC addresses are learned from another interface, then +2 more entries 
will added in the user entries table.

Command «authentication mode multi-authen max-user 3» limits user entries for 
users in ANY user status (Open, Success, Pre-authen, Client-no-resp, Fail-authorized). 
It does not mean that user entries will be limited only for users in Success status. 
For example, if user entries table already contain 3 users: first in status Open, 
second in status Success, and last in status Pre-authen, this means there are no more 
available users entries.

4.  Since authentication profile include command «authentication event authen-fail
action authorize service-scheme authen-fail» and associated ACL permit all IPs, 
it was expected that the stack switch grants all right to all users who have failed 
in authentication. 
https://support.huawei.com/hedex/hdx.do?docid=EDOC1100247314&id=EN-US_CLIREF_0176369660

It was expected that all users who have failed in authentication will have status 
«Fail-authorized» under command «display access-user».
https://support.huawei.com/hedex/hdx.do?docid=EDOC1100247314&id=EN-US_CLIREF_0176369444

[Failure scenario]:

1.  Accidentally another access switch was connected to the port GigabitEthernet2/0/5
of the stack.

2.  The connected switch had many video devices connected to it, which means they do 
send multicast traffic.

3.  All the video devices were from another network, and did not require authentication.

4.  Due STP was disabled on the connected switch, bpdu protection function did
not shutdown the port.

5.  152 MAC-addresses was learned by interface GigabitEthernet2/0/5:

<swX>display mac-address GigabitEthernet2/0/5

Total items displayed = 152

6.  GigabitEthernet2/0/5 started dropped multicast and broadcast traffic:

#Jun 19 2024 14:40:05+03:00 swX SECE/4/TRAFFICSUPPRESSION_DROP_ALARM:OID 
1.3.6.1.4.1.2011.5.25.32.4.1.14.3 Incoming packet loss occurs due to traffic 
suppression. (IfIndex=118, IfName=GigabitEthernet2/0/5, BroadcastPktDropped=988160, 
MulticastPktDropped=15402, UnicastPktDropped=0, KnownMulticastPktDropped=0, 
KnownUnicastPktDropped=0)

7.  The logs displayed that every 5-7 minutes the stack tries to authenticate each 
MAC learned by interface over and over again:

2024-06-18 23:00:50+03:00 swX %%01CM/5/USER_ACCESSRESULT(s)[1228265]:Slot=1,Vcpu=3;

after almost 6 minutes later:

8.  The number of NAC users reaches the upper limit on the stack:

2024-06-19 14:36:21+03:00 swX %%01CM/3/ALLOCUSERFAIL(l)[57]:Slot=1,Vcpu=3;The number 
of NAC users reaches the upper limit.(UserIP:192.168.XX.XX,Mac:f023-XXXX-XXXX,
Interface:GigabitEthernet2/0/5)

Jun 19 2024 12:13:44+03:00 swX AAA/4/NACMaxUserAlarm:Slot=1,Vcpu=4;OID 1.3.6.1.4.1.
2011.5.2.2.2.0.107 The number of NAC users reached the maximum.(Slot:All User-num:1000 
Threshold:100%)

Wired users connected to the stack began to complain that they could not connect to 
the network or lost their connection.


[Analysis]:

1.  It was clear that «port-security max-mac-num 2» command did not take effect: 
152 MAC-addresses was learned instead of 2. But this is not a software error. One of 
the precautions in doc reads:"When both NAC authentication and port security are enabled 
on an interface, MAC addresses that fail to be authenticated are not converted to secure 
MAC addresses. Instead, they are learned as authentication MAC addresses on the interface.
After authentication succeeds, the MAC addresses are converted to secure MAC addresses."
https://support.huawei.com/hedex/hdx.do?docid=EDOC1100247314&id=EN-US_CLIREF_0177118125

In other words, port-security only works for "secure" MAC addresses. 
In order for the dynamic MAC address to converted to secure MAC addresses, the user must 
be successfully authenticated.
In the failure scenario none of the 152 MAC addresses could be successfully authenticated, 
therefore, as we can see, they received the status authentication "authen" and was not 
rectricted by port security.

2.  Considering that there are usually no more than 50 users on the stack, it looks 
strange that users entry table has reached the upper limit of 1000 users. There were 50 
users on the stack when issue occurred, and 152 came from another switch. So the total 
should be 202 users in NAC users entry table. Not 1000.
It is clear that «authentication mode multi-authen max-user 3» command did not take effect. 
Only 3 new entries had to be added to the NAC users entry table. According the concept
these users had to get the Pre-authen status first, and then the Fail-authorized status.
Unfortunately, we do not have a picture of what status users had at that time, since we 
did not observe the incident during its course, but only analyzed the logs. 
Theoretically, and in our test conditions, this should be exactly like that.

The malfunction of the command «authentication mode multi-authen max-user 3» explains why
authentication requests were triggered by stack for each of the 152 MAC addresses in the 
mac address table, but that doesn't explain why the number of NAC users reaches the upper 
limit on the stack of 1000 users.

3.  Every incoming L2 packet that arrived on the interface GigabitEthernet2/0/5 
triggered authentication over and over again for each MAC-address. It was occured 
every 5-7 minutes for each MAC-address, despite the fact that the user has already received 
its status and was added in NAC user entry table. We have already seen similar behavior 
in another bug, when DHCP packets triggered authentication over and over again, 
despite the fact that the user was already authenticated (we had to disable the trigger 
for DHCP packets).
The process number for each authentication request was unique, and for two identical 
MAC addresses, two records with different process numbers can be generated. 
At this point, we think NAC was adding new records to the entry table without deleting the 
old ones, even though they belonged to the same user.
Clearing old entries should have happened, of course, but it doesn't happen in time. 
Given the amount of traffic, there were significantly more add requests than NAC was able 
to clear old entries per unit of time.

[Resume]

From all of the above, it is clear that the switch has a security hole, 
the NAC algorithms are not working correctly and must be fixed. 
Even such a small number of broadcast and multicast packets from 152 devices caused the 
failure of the NAC function, in which existing users began to lose connectivity and 
could not get online again. 

 
[RND reply]

Current implementation mechanism of device is as following: 
device authenticates all the mac-addresses that send arp/dhcp/any-l2-packet packets, 
therefore 152 MAC addresses are displayed in the "display mac-address" command output.
Theoretically, the "display access-user" command output also should show that 152 users
are in the pre-authen state. 

We admit that the current implementation mechanism has problems, so we confirm that 
this mechanism will be modified in R24 version.
After the modification, as per current customer configuration, only 2 mac-addresses 
are displayed in the "display mac-address" command output and only 3 users are 
displayed in the "display access-user" command output.
